Enhancement: now aliases with and without the `.js` extension. Allows for `require('a.js')` and `require('a')`, which are equivalent.

Bug fix: it was possible to not actually transform the bundle.

## 0.1.4
Initial release. Docs complete, tests pass, and module structure in place. This was my first use of gulp, so there's a lot of 0.0.* commits while I worked out the release process.
